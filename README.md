Vehicle speed detection

        Vehicle speed detection is used to estimate the velocity of the moving vehicle using image and video processing techniques. Without any camera calibrations video is captured and analyzed for speed in real time. By employing frame subtraction and masking techniques, moving vehicles are segmented out. Speed is calculated using the time taken between frames and corner detected object traversed in that frames. Finally frame masking is used to differentiate between one or more vehicles. With an average error of +/-2 km/h speed detection was achieved for different video sequences.
